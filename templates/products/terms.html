                                Then the 0.01 bid is shows “not unique”, 0.02 shows “not unique”, 0.03 shows also “not unique”, 0.04 is shows “Lowest & unique bid” and the 0.05 shows “Unique but not lowest”. So finally, the winner is the 0.04 that means the bidder 8 is the winner and he/she will be declared as the winner at the auction close. All the auction winners are declared as soon as the auction closes, sometimes there may be a period of up to 72 working hours from when an Auction closes until the auction results are announced. This period is to allow for the reconciliation of Bids and the auditing of results for genuine winner if server detects any fraud if fund auction will be cancelled & the corresponding user will be blocked from our platform temporarily.

If We determine that Your Item has developed a fault within what We consider to be a reasonable time, We will arrange for the Item to be collected from You at Our expense and a repaired or replacement Item will be returned to You within a reasonable time, again at Our expense. Where We are unable to provide a repaired or replacement Item, We reserve the right to issue a full refund of the purchase price, which will constitute full consideration for the Item. Where the Item appears to have been the subject of abuse, accidental damage or misuse We reserve the right to refuse to provide a repaired or replacement Item and to charge You for the cost of Us collecting the Item from You and returning the Item to You. For Items which store data, it is Your responsibility to backup Your own data prior to the Item being returned; any repaired or replacement Item will be returned to You without any of Your personal data or files.

                    <p>
                        We are not liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of Our obligations under a Contract that is caused by any act, event, non-happening, omission or accident beyond Our reasonable control. Such events are called ‘Force Majeure Events’ and include particularly, without limitation; strikes, lock-outs or other industrial action; civil commotion, riot, invasion, terrorist attack or threat of terrorist attack, war (whether declared or not) or threat or preparation for war, fire, explosion, implosion, storm, flood, earthquake, subsidence, epidemic or other natural disaster; impossibility of the use of railways, shipping, aircraft, motor transport or other means of public or private transport; impossibility of the use of public or private telecommunications networks; and, the acts, decrees, legislation, regulations or restrictions of any government.

                        Our performance under any Contract is deemed to be suspended for the period that the force majeure event continues, and We will have an extension of time for performance for the duration of that period. We will use Our reasonable endeavours to bring the force majeure event to a close or to find a reasonable alternative solution by which We are able to perform Our obligation under the Contract despite the force majeure event.
